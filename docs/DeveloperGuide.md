**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internhunter/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `MainParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. deleting an application).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as switching
tabs or displaying the matching internships window to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete app 1")`
API call.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Implementation of `Command` classes

#### Current Implementation
There are 4 different subclasses of `Item` in InternHunter, namely `Company`, `Internship`, `Application`, and
`Profile`. <br/>

There are 2 types of commands:
- Commands that are dependent on the type of `Item`
    - e.g. `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `EditCommand`
    - These commands are implemented as _abstract_ classes that inherit from the `Command` class. Type specific
    commands like `AddCompanyCommand` and `AddApplicationCommand` inherit from the _abstract_ `AddCommand`
    class
- Commands that are not dependent on the type of `Item`
    - e.g. `SwitchCommand`, `HelpCommand`, `ExitCommand`
    - These commands are implemented as _concrete_ classes and inherit directly from the `Command` class

From this point on, we will be using `ABCCommand` to represent commands that are dependent on type and
`XYZCommand` to represent commands that are independent of type.

The following shows the class diagram for `Command` and its subclasses:

![CommandClassDiagram](images/CommandClassDiagram.png)

Figure xx. `ABCCommand` refers to a command dependent on type while `XYZCommand` refers to a command indepedent of type

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: Whether `ABCCommand` should be abstract and split into 4 other `ABCItemCommand` or handle the 4 `Item` types on its own

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `ABCCommand` is split into 4 other `ABCItemCommand`. Parser parses the
user input and creates the specific `ABCItemCommand` for execution. The following activity diagram shows how the 
execution of the `AddApplicationCommand` will work.

![AddApplicationCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddApplicationCommandActivityDiagram.png)

- Pros: 
    - Each command has its own specific task to execute. This means that classes are more flexible and can be changed
    very easily. 
    - Higher cohesion as the class is only dependent on the one `Item` type
    - Short and concise `execute` method, providing better readability and maintainability
- Cons:
    - More classes have to be created
        
- **Alternative 2**: `ABCCommand` is a _concrete_ class and handles the execution of all 4 `Item` types.
Parser parses the user input and creates the general `ABCCommand` for execution. The following
activity diagram shows how the `AddCommand` will work.

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

- Pros:
    - Only one command is needed, reducing the number of classes created
- Cons:
    - `execute` method becomes extremely long as it needs to contain switch statements to handle the execution of
    command X for the 4 different types of `Item`
    - `ABCCommand` class is vulnerable to drastic changes when the parsing method of any one `Item` class changes
    - `ABCCommand` class holds more dependencies as it is now dependent on the 4 `Item` classes  
    - Poor readability and maintainability
    - A slight overhead increase as `Item` type needs to be passed in as a parameter to the `ABCCommand`,
    additional check for nullity in the parameter passed in is required

**Conclusion**: Our group settled on the first design, since it better adheres to OOP principles such as
Single Responsibility Principle. Our design meant that each specific `Item` command is only dependent on the `Item`
itself and not subjected to the changes in implementation of the other `Item` classes. This means that it will only
have one reason to change. Moreover, this leads to lower coupling, which makes maintenance, integration and
testing easier. This ended up being a good choice as we had some changes in the parsing requirements of one
of the `Item` classes, `Internship`. If we had gone with the second design, the concrete `ABCCommand` might
have broken down as it might not be suited to the different parsing requirements in the of the `Internship` item.

### Delete company feature

#### What it is
Users are able to execute a command to delete a company from their list of companies in InterHunter. Upon the 
successful deletion of a company, all internships within that company, if any, will also be deleted (as they are a 
part of the company, i.e. companies and the internships that they offer have a whole-part / composition relationship). 
As a result, all applications made to internships from the company to be deleted, if any, will also be deleted as per 
the delete internship feature. This feature is intended to be used when the user is viewing the Company tab. However, 
the user is free to execute the delete company command while they are on another tab, and InternHunter will simply 
switch over to the Company tab if and when the command has finished executing successfully.

**Command format**: `delete com INDEX`
* Where `INDEX` is the index of the company to be deleted in the list of companies

#### Implementation
Upon a user’s entry of a valid delete company command, a `DeleteCompanyCommand` object is created. 
`DeleteCompanyCommand` is a class that extends the `DeleteCommandAbstract` abstract class that in turn extends the 
`Command` abstract class.

![DeleteCompanyCommandClassDiagram](images/DeleteCompanyCommandClassDiagram.png)

`DeleteCompanyCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the 
method will delete the respective company in the model’s list of companies if a valid index is given.

This is how the `DeleteCompanyCommand#execute()` method works upon execution:

1. The tab that the user is currently viewing is obtained via the `Model#getTabName()` method.
2. The company to be deleted is retrieved from the model’s `companyList` via the `CommandUtil#getCompany()` method.
3. All the internships within the company, if any, are deleted via a self-invocation to `DeleteCompanyCommand`’s own 
 `deleteAllInternshipsInCompany()` method.
4. The company is then deleted from the model via the `model#deleteCompany()` method.
5. The deletion is successful and a `CommandResult` is returned with an appropriate success message to indicate 
 operation success via the `CommandUtil#getCommandResult()` method. The `CommandResult` also indicates whether the tab 
 needs to be switched to the Company tab or not, based on if the user was already viewing the Company tab or not as 
 retrieved in Step 1.

The following sequence diagrams show how the delete company feature works successfully, using the example command 
`delete com 3`:

![DeleteCompanyCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteCompanyCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
![ExecuteDeleteCompany3CommandSequenceDiagram](images/ExecuteDeleteCompany3CommandSequenceDiagram.png)
![GetDeleteCommandResultSequenceDiagram](images/GetDeleteCommandResultSequenceDiagram.png)
HandleDeleteDisplaySwitchIndexSequenceDiagram can be found [here](#handle-delete-display-switch-index-sequence-diagram)

#### Design considerations
* Obtaining the tab that the user is currently viewing has to be done before deleting all the company’s internships 
via the `DeleteCompanyCommand#deleteAllInternshipsInCompany()` method. This is because the 
`DeleteCompanyCommand#deleteAllInternshipsInCompany()` method executes `DeleteInternshipCommands`, and 
`DeleteInternshipCommands` will cause the model to switch tabs to the Company tab internally (i.e. updates are made to 
the relevant objects’ fields but this change is not reflected via the GUI). The implication of this behaviour is that 
if the model’s tab is obtained after the `DeleteCompanyCommand#deleteAllInternshipsInCompany()` method is executed, 
then it will always reflect that the model is on the Company tab and hence no switching of tabs is necessary GUI-wise. 
In other words, if the user successfully executes the delete company command whilst not on the Company tab, the tab 
will not be switched to the Company tab in the GUI, which is undesirable. Our implementation resolves this issue.
* The `DeleteCompanyCommand#deleteAllInternshipsInCompany()` method works by creating and executing a 
`DeleteInternshipCommand` for every internship in the company’s list of internships. This implementation was chosen 
because `DeleteInternshipCommand` handles deleting any application made to the internship that is being deleted. As 
such, the delete company command will exhibit the behaviour whereby any applications made to internships offered by a 
company that is being deleted will also be deleted, which is the behaviour we believe is appropriate and hence wanted 
to achieve.

#### Alternatives considered
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Delete all applications made to internships from the company to be deleted by
 executing delete internship commands.
  * Pros:
    * Avoids rewriting code / code duplication by calling methods that have already been implemented to achieve the 
    desired functionality.
    * Ensures consistent behaviour - when an internship is deleted because a company is deleted, what happens to any 
    application for that internship will be the same as what would happen to it if a delete internship command was 
    executed directly by the user for the same internship.
  * Cons:
    * Introduces a dependency on `DeleteInternshipCommand`.

* **Alternative 2**: Delete all applications made to internships from the company to be deleted without executing
delete internship commands, i.e. by implementing delete internship command’s internal workings.
  * Pros:
    * Not dependent on `DeleteInternshipCommand`.
  * Cons:
    * Introduces dependencies on `InternshipItem` and `ApplicationItem`.
    * Violates the DRY principle:
      * Introduces code duplication.
      * Decentralizes the behaviour of what happens to an application made for an internship that is being deleted, 
      since there are now 2 separate implementations for this (one in `DeleteCompanyCommand` and the other in 
      `DeleteInternshipCommand`). The implications of this are:
        * Cannot guarantee consistent behaviour - when an internship is deleted because a company is deleted, what 
        happens to any application for that internship may not be the same as what would happen to it if a delete 
        internship command was executed directly by the user for the same internship.
        * Updating this behaviour will require updating code in both places rather than one centralised place.

### User Profile feature

The user profile feature behaves like a resume for the user to keep track of noteworthy events and milestones in one
's professional life. There are three categories of profile items namely: `ACHIEVEMENT`, `SKILL` and `EXPERIENCE
`.

#### Editing User profile item

The `edit me` command for the user profile allows the user to update the fields of the each profile item by
specifying the targeted index and at least one field. 

#### Implementation

* The `edit me` command is implemented by the `EditProfileCommandParser` and `EditProfileCommand`.
* `EditProfileCommandParser#parse` method creates a `EditProfileItemDescriptor` based on the fields of the input
 provided by the user. The `EditProfileItemDescriptor` is then used in instantiating the `EditProfileCommand`.

* `EditProfileCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution
, the method will edit the specified profile item in the model’s profile item.



The following sequence diagrams show how the editing profile Item feature works successfully, using the example command 
`edit me t/HTML`:

![EditProfileCommandSequenceDiagramSimplified](images/dg-profile/EditProfileCommandSequenceDiagramSimplified.png)


1. After the user enters an input  to edit the user profile, the input is first parsed by the `MainParser` looks out
 for the command word, recognizes the `edit` command and  funnels the input to `EditCommandParser`.
2. The `EditCommandParser` then identifies the item type, which is profile item and returns the
 `EditProfileCommandParser`.
3. The `EditProfileCommandParser` then parses for the index and fields to be edited and returns a `EditProfileCommand` 
containing a editProfileItemDescriptor. The following sequence diagram depicts how the `EditProfileCommand` works:

![ExecuteEditMeCommand](images/dg-profile/ExecuteEditMeCommand.png)

4. The `EditProfileCommand` is executed by `LogicManager` which retrieves the targeted `profileItemToEdit` from the
 `lastShownList` *(which contains the profile items the user is able to see)* and updates the model with the
  `editedProfileItem` associated with the `EditProfileCommand`.
5. CommandResult is return to indicate a successful operation.
 
#### Design considerations

#### Aspect: How EditProfileCommand Object interacts with Model
##### Alternatives considered
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `EditProfileCommand` interact with the model solely and not directly with model's 
 internal components: `ProfileItemList` and `FilteredProfileItemList`.
  * Pros:
    * This obeys the Law of Demeter which stresses for components to avoid interacting directly with internal
     components of other objects. This reduces coupling which increases testability as `EditProfileCommand` only
     requires one model
      stub as opposed to more objects stubs for testing.
    * This also increases maintainability as `EditProfileCommand` only has to be concerned with the methods that
     `Model` provides and not the other implementation details should they be subjected to change.
  * Cons:
    * This increases code volume within `Model` as the model need to hold every method to interact with all the
   collections it contains.

* **Alternative 2 (used in v1.2)**: Due to the presence of other collections such as `companyList` in the model, the
 `filteredProfileLists` and `profileList` are both retrieved from the model within the `EditProfileCommand` and then the
  `setItemList()` operation is called directly on the `profileList` to update its value.
  
  ```
  model.getProfileList().setItem(profileItemToEdit, EditedProfileItem)
  ```
![ExecuteEditMeCommandAlt.png](images/dg-profile/ExecuteEditMeCommandAlt.png)

  * Pros: 
    * This reduces code volume by keeping `Model` lean and for `EditProfileObject`to interact with the objects it needs.
    * This may marginally improve performance as it bypasses the `Model` to interact with the `profileList` and
     `filteredProfileList` directly.
  * Cons:
    * This exposes the internal components of the `Model` which increases coupling as `EditProfileCommand` is now
     dependent on `filteredProfileList` and `profileList` of the `ItemListManager` reduces testability and
      maintainability.
    

### Switch screen feature

#### What it is
Users are able to execute a command to switch their tabs in InterHunter. There are 3 tabs, Company, Application, Profile. Take for example swithcing to the company tab, upon the successful switch of the tabs, the screen will now display a list of companies and also display the information of the last known index of that tab, i.e if the index that was previously saved in that tab was the 3rd index, when switching back to this tab, it will show the information of the 3rd index.

**Command format**: `switch TYPE`
`TYPE` is the type of tab.
There are three `TYPE`s:
* `com`
* `app`
* `me`

#### Implementation
Upon a user’s entry of a valid switch command, a `SwitchCommand` object is created. `SwitchCommand` is a class that extends the Command abstract class as well as having direct association with TabName, an enumeration, as well as having a dependency to the Model interface as it relies on some of its method.

<p align="left"><img src="images/switchcommand/SwitchCommandClassDiagram.png" width="70%" height="70%"/></p>

`SwitchCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the 
method will switch the tab and the screen if a valid command is provided.

This is how the `SwitchCommand#execute()` method works upon execution:
1. The current tab that the user is viewing is obtained via the `Model#getTabName()` method.
2. The input tab will be check against the current tab. <br/>
 2a. If both the tabs are the same, a same tab message will be passed to `CommandUtil#getCommandResult()`method. <br/>
 2b. If both the tabs are different, a success message will be passed to `CommandUtil#getCommandResult()`method. <br/>

<p align="center">The overall process of how <code>SwitchCommand</code> was generated.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/switchcommand/SwitchCommandSequenceDiagram.png"/></p>

<p align="center">The process of how <code>SwitchCommand</code> interacts with the model.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ExecuteSwitchMeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="75%" height="75%"/></p>

This is how the `CommandUtil#getCommandResult()` method works upon execution:
1. The current tab that the user is viewing is obtained via the `Model#getTabName()` method.
2. The input tab will be check against the current tab. <br/>
 2a. If both the tabs are the same, a `CommandResult` with a same tab message is return.
 2b. If both the tabs are different, we will change the tab to the input's tab name via `Model#setTabName()`. A `CommandResult` with a success message is return.

<p align="center">The process of how <code>getCommandResult</code>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/GetCommandResultSequenceDiagram.png" width="95%" height="95%"/></p>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a switch command:

![SwitchCommandActivityDiagram](images/switchcommand/SwitchCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The above activity diagram shows the logic and the path execution when the switch command is executed. The code will check if there is any missing input or if the input is not one of the three mentioned in the `Command format` above. If the aforementioned 2 conditions are not met, an error message is displayed. If the input is one of the three mentioned above in the `Command format`, there will be further checks if the user are already in the same tab.

#### Design considerations
#### Aspect: Should the tabs be allowed to change only by the `SwitchCommand`.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow the switch of tabs to not only be accessible via the switch command, but rather extract it out for all commands excluding `exit` and `help`.
    * Pros:
        * Allows user to type once instead of twice when executing a single command and wanting to view it. (This optimzation is to allow for a faster way to type and view the changes). <br/>
        * By abstract the method out from switch command, it obeys the DRY principle as all the commands will be calling a single method.
        * This allows and obeys the Open-Close princple as new implementation of commands can just be calling this single method at the end.
        * Allows user to have a second alternative to switch tabs for just viewing purpose.
    * Cons:
        * User might switch tab accidentally because of inputting the wrong `TYPE`.
        * Increases some form of coupling between all commands as they are now linked to this single method.
* **Alternative 2:** Only allow switch command to be the only way to switch tabs.
    * Pros:
        * This introduces a "type-safe" checks like in Java where only if the user is in the correct tab, then he or she will be able to add items to that item type. <br/>
    * Cons:
        * This introduces the need to type twice in order to view the execution of the command.

### Storage Feature

#### What it is
After a command is successfully executed, InternHunter automatically saves users' data to JSON files. Moreover, 
everytime the `GuiSettings` is modified, InternHunter updates the user preferences JSON file. Users can transfer or 
backup the JSON files manually. The storage component is responsible for both reading and saving the data.

#### Implementation
InternHunter uses Jackson, a high-performance JSON processor for Java. It can  serialize Java objects into JSON and 
deserialize JSON into Java objects. InternHunter's model has 4 different types of data: `ApplicationItem`, 
`CompanyItem`, `InternshipItem`, and `ProfileItem`. They first need to be converted to Jackson-friendly versions of 
themselves, where each field is a string or another Jackson-friendly object. User preference is saved as a `UserPrefs` 
object.
 
 [Storage structure diagram](#storage-class-diagram)
 
 * `Storage` handles the storage for all `Item` lists and user preferences.
 * `UserPrefsStorage` handles the storage for user preferences.
 * `ItemListStorage` handles the storage for `Item` lists.
 * `JsonSerializableItemList` represents a Jackson-friendly version of an `Item` list.
 * `JsonAdaptedItem` represents a Jackson-friendly version of an `Item`.
 
 ![JsonAdaptedItemClassDiagram](images/JsonAdaptedItemClassDiagram.png)
 
 `JsonAdaptedItem` is an abstract class representing Jackson-friendly version of the `Item` class in the model component.
  It has one method `toModelType()` which convert itself to an `Item` object. There are 4 classes extending 
  `JsonAdaptedItem`:
  * `JsonAdaptedApplicationItem` the Jackson-friendly version of `ApplicationItem`.
  * `JsonAdaptedCompanyItem` the Jackson-friendly version of `CompanyItem`.
  * `JsonAdaptedInternshipItem` the Jackson-friendly version of `InternshipItem`.
  * `JsonAdaptedProfileItem` the Jackson-friendly version of `ProfileItem`.
  
InternHunter automatically saves user data after every command. The following sequence diagram demonstrates how
InternHunter does it. Let `commandString` be any valid command string.
  
![SavingDataSequenceDiagram](images/SavingDataSequenceDiagram.png)
  
#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to handle 3 types of 'Item' list

InternHunter maintains 3 types of `Item` list: `ApplicationItem`, `CompanyItem`, and `ProfileItem` lists.
Both `ItemListStorage` and `JsonSerializableItemList` use  the same logic regardless of the `Item` type.
* **Alternative 1: current choice**: Creates a base abstract class `JsonAdaptedItem` and makes `ItemListStorage` 
and `JsonSerializableItemList` use generics.
    * Pros: 
        * Adheres to OOP principle, polymorphism.
        * Less code duplication.
        * Makes adding a new `Item` type easy. To be able to save and read a new `Item` type, only a new 
        class representing its Jackson-friendly version needs to be created.
        * Makes further extension to the `ItemListStorage` and `JsonSerializableItemList` faster.

    * Cons:
        * More complicated as Jackson does not provide a direct way to convert a generic object to its JSON format.

* **Alternative 2**: Each `Item` type has their own `ItemListStorage` and `JsonSerializableItemList`.
    * Pros:
        * Easier to implement.
    
    * Cons:
        * Much longer code with much duplication.
        * Adding a new `Item` type requires at least 3 new classes to be made.
        * Extending the `ItemListStorage` and `JsonSerializableItemList` class would require changes to all the
        different versions corresponding to the different `Item` types.

### Clear Feature

#### What it is
In the beginning, user can see how the app works with sample data. After that, user can decide to 
clear all the entries in InternHunter with just a `clear` command.

#### Implementation

The following diagram illustrates whether InternHunter use sample data.

![SampleDataActivityDiagram](images/SampleDataActivityDiagram.png)

When user enters the `clear` command, InternHunter will reset all three lists. Here is a sequence diagram showcasing how
InternHunter does it.

![ClearCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to clear the lists

InternHunter only lets users create applications for internships already added to companies.

* **Alternative 1: current choice**: Clear all three lists at once.
    * Pros: 
        * Guarantees data consistency.
        
    * Cons:
        * Less freedom for the users.

* **Alternative 2**: Each list can be cleared individually.
    * Pros:
        * Users can choose which lists to be cleared.
    
    * Cons:
        * High risk of data inconsistency due to the linkage between company and application lists.

### Match Command feature

#### What it is
Users are able to execute a command to generate a list of matching internships that matches their current profile
skills. This matching is done by accumulating the list of profile items that has the category `SKILL` and
filtering the list of internships from them. Remaining internships are those that consist of at least one
`Requirement` that matches the user's list of skills. 

**Command format:** `match`

#### Implementation

`MatchCommand` is a class that extends the `Command` _abstract_ class. It has a dependency to the `Model`
interface as it relies on getting the profile list and company item list from the model.

Here is a class diagram to show how the `MatchCommand` is implemented:

![MatchCommandClassDiagram](images/MatchCommandClassDiagram.png)

This is how the `MatchCommand#execute()` method works upon execution:

1. The list of profile items and company items are first obtained via the `Model#getProfileItemList()` method and
`Model#getCompanyItemList()` respectively.
2. Then, the list of profile skills that the user has is obtained via a self-invocation to
`MatchCommand`'s own `getSkillList(...)` method.
3. Next, the list of all internships from the list of companies is obtained via its own
`getInternshipList(...)` method.
4. Then, the `MatchCommand`'s own `getMatchingInternships(...)` is invoked to obtain
the list of matching internships.
5. Finally, `MatchCommand`'s own `getMatchingInternshipsCommandResult(...)` is used to generate the
`CommandResult`. This method returns different `CommandResult` depending if the matchingInternships is empty or not. 
 5a. If the matchingInternships list is empty, then no matching internships message will be passed to the `CommandResult`.
 5b. Otherwise, the showing matching internships message will be passed to the `CommandResult`. This internship list
 will be passed into `CommandResult#setMatchingInternships(...)` method.

The following sequence diagram show how the match command works:

![MatchCommandClassDiagram](images/MatchCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to generate the matching internships

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Methods to generate the matching internships, namely `getSkillList`, 
`getInternshipList`, and `getMatchingInternships` are implemented within `MatchCommand`.

- Pros:
    - Still adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle as the `MatchCommand` is meant to generate the list of
    matching internships. Having additional methods to match internships to profile skills are still within the
    responsibility of this class
    - Higher cohesion as `Model` does not need to have additional responsibilities like executing algorithms
    - Increased flexibility as the matching algorithm can be easily changed within this `MatchCommand`
    
- Cons:
    - `MatchCommand` becomes longer as it needs additional methods to generate the list of matching internships

**Alternative 2:** Methods to generate the matching internships, namely `getSkillList`, 
`getInternshipList`, and `getMatchingInternships` are implemented within `Model`.

- Pros:
    - `MatchCommand` will be very short as it just needs to call the `getMatchingInternships` method from the
    `Model` interface and generate the correct `CommandResult` from there
    
- Cons:
    - `Model` becomes more complicated as it needs to support more methods. This in turns causes the `ModelManager`
    class, which implements the `Model` interface to be overly complex as it needs to provide the algorithms to
    filter and generate the matching internship list.
    - Lower cohesion as the `Model` interface has additional responsibilities and functionalities.
    `Model` now has to deal with algorithms, instead of keeping to what a `Model` does which is to manage the app data
    of the user.
